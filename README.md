# space_invaders.rb

Classic arcade game Space Invaders written in Ruby w/ [Gosu](https://github.com/jlnr/gosu).

## Getting Started

The game is packed as a gem, so you can simply run:

    $ gem install space_invaders
    $ space-invaders

Or you can clone the repo and run

    $ ruby go.rb
    
## Troubles with installation:

 If you have problems installing the game, you're probably missing some OS specific libraries that Gosu uses. For further information checkout:
